# Joni-s-portfolio
Joni's portfolio. This was my first try to create a portfolio. It's full of coding mistakes, but I don't have the intention to fix these mistakes as it would require a lot of time. Also this reminds me of how far I've come. I would erase a part of my history if I pretended these mistakes didn't exist. I think it's not a bad portfolio for a beginner, and also the end result is not too bad considering it's a static website.

I will make an improved portfolio once I have enough time and energy, but it can't be static and that means 
I'll need to use a hosting service.

br, 

Joni
