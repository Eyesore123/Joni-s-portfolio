        <h2>
        Who am I?
        </h2>
        <p>Hey, my name is Joni. I'm a male, 31 years old. Currently I'm working as a sports secretary in the municipality of Ilomantsi. I graduated from University of Jyväskylä in 2019, with three master's degrees in my pocket, and a couple of years later I ended up here in Ilomantsi. I guess I'm lucky for having been able to work in a job that fits my education. I could see myself working in a whole new different field in the future, though.</p> 
        <p>I'm a nerd who's into all sorts of things. On my own time I read books, play computer and console games, lift weights, build computers and learn to code. I'm still trying to figure out what to do with my life, but right now I'm focused and dedicate several hours each day to coding. Coding is honestly really hard, but I like the feeling of how I get absorbed in it. I could see myself working in software industry in the future, but who knows? </p>
        <p>
        Um, what else? Well, I'm an introverted, calm and focused person. I have one degree from philosophy so occasionally I might sound like a philosopher and be argumentative. One person that I knew years ago told me that I'm an observer when it comes to personality traits - I tend to watch and react only after thinking things through. Admittedly she was right, I'm an introvert after all, but I've always seen it as a positive. I can be socially adept under right circumstances. I have my patience with stupidity, but I'm not going to tag along for long when I get bored or when people test me with their drama and stupid remarks.
        </p>
        <p>I try to be courageous in life, meet new people, try new things and venture in new projects in order to counterbalance my natural introvertedness.
